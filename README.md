# Auburnite

Auburnite is a set of reusable PHP components, Created by
[Jordan Wamser](https://github.com/jmwamser)
from [RedPanda Coding](https://github.com/redpandacoding).

### Thanks
I want to say thanks to the Symfony Core Team and Community for reference ideas
on how to structure this collection of projects.

As well a reference guide that I used to put this together from [LogRocket]
(https://blog.logrocket.com/hosting-all-your-php-packages-together-in-a-monorepo/)
by [Leonardo Losoviz](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/leonardolosoviz/).

With this repo being a Monorepo, I will be using [Splitsh/Lite](https://github.com/splitsh/lite)
to help manage all this.

### Tools
Since we will be managing this Monorepo with `Splitsh/Lite` here are the
sets I used to set this all up. I am on a MacOS M1 system, all documentation
expects that is what you are using.

TODO: add other systems setup steps if needed.

#### MacOS
1. install libgit2 with package manager. (I'm using `Brew`)
